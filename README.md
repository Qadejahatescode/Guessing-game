# ðŸŽ® Backend Guessing Game

## Description
Welcome to the **Guessing Game**! This is a simple game where the player attempts to guess a random number generated by the server. The game is purely backend-based, meaning no front-end interface is required. All interactions take place via API endpoints.

The game logic is built using Node.js and you can easily integrate it with any front-end framework if needed.
One of the projects i did in a 6 week bootcamp

## How the Game Works
1. The server generates a random number within a specified range.
2. The player sends guesses via API requests.
3. The server responds with whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

## Features
- Random number generation for each new game.
- Tracks the number of attempts made by the player.
- Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Simple API to interact with the game.
